# Section 1: Class Familiarity
## Class Creation

## Class Vairables/Attributes

## Getters and Setters
### What are they?
Because of the nature of OOP, you cannot directly access the attributes of the object (instantiated instance of a class). For example, as seen above in BasicClass or Robot, the attributes of Value and goal cannot directly be assessed. Therefore we need getter functions to return the values, and setter functions that will set those values.
