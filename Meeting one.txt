Focus and advertise towards 3001 after a few weeks. Assumes basic MATLAB knowledge:
	- Create class from scratch: Plotting not reusable for 3001
		- Live plot the data
			- Two lines with legend
		- Save a single figure of final output
		- subplots of velocity and position
	- Give a .m of finished data that is controls based (multiple)
	- Have points where the documentation has the answer
Using the documentation for first 10 minutes

Zach: Generate .m files and sample plots of the output
Brandon: Create github repo
Kalina: Form ideas for the plotting class methods
	- Potential ideas:
		- Make live plot
		- Input data
		- Save plot velocity with position
		- Save plot for final product
